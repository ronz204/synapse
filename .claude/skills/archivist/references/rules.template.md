# <Name> Conventions

<!--
One short paragraph: what this covers, what runtime/toolchain it targets, and
what's explicitly out of scope for now. Omit the `paths:` frontmatter entirely
only if this rule is meant to be global (rare).
-->

---

## <Topic 1>

<!-- Bullet list. Each bullet states the convention AND the reason ("X, because Y") — a bare "must" invites being silently violated the first time it's inconvenient. -->

## <Topic 2>

---

## Non-goals

<!-- Optional. Include only if this rule is easy to over-apply — e.g. a convention that shouldn't be retrofitted onto an explicitly-excepted case. -->
